Matrix - Google Summer of Code
==============================

Getting in touch
----------------

You can contact the Matrix team via our [Matrix HQ room](https://vector.im/beta/#/room/#matrix:matrix.org) - or on IRC in [#matrix on freenode](irc://irc.freenode.net/matrix) (an example server on freenode is irc.freenode.net). 

How do I pick a project?
------------------------

The first thing to do, is to have a play with Matrix. Register an account on the matrix.org homeserver via a client like [Vector](https://vector.im) (or any of the clients listed on the ["try matrix now"](http://matrix.org/docs/projects/try-matrix-now.html) page). Join some rooms, for example [#matrix:matrix.org](https://vector.im/beta/#/room/#matrix:matrix.org) and say hello - in fact you can now even join as an anonymous user via that link. 

[This guide](http://matrix.org/docs/guides/getting_involved.html) has a lot of information about getting involved. Perhaps you might want to run your own client, or even set up your own homeserver? Check out [the code](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse) and have a look at the [client-server API](https://matrix.org/docs/api/client-server/).

In order to find a project you would like to work on, we suggest reading our latest [status update](https://matrix.org/blog/2015/12/25/the-matrix-holiday-special/) and looking at the [ideas](https://github.com/matrix-org/GSoC/blob/master/IDEAS.md) list - and then thinking about what you would like to add to the Matrix ecosystem. Of course, please also come talk and discuss your idea with us (in [#matrix:matrix.org](https://vector.im/beta/#/room/#matrix:matrix.org) for example), but it's important that you find a project that you find interesting yourself!
